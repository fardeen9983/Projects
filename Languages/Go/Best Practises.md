# Best Practises in Programming
## Understandability
* Code is composed of functions & data
* If you are asked to find a feature, find it quickly
* If you are asked about where data is used, you should know

## Debugging Principles
If a code Crashes in a function, there can be only two causes
1. The function is written incorrectly
2. Data that the function is using is incorrect

Supporting Debugging:
* Functions need to be understandable
  * Determine if actual behavior matches desired behavior
* Data needs to be traceable
  * Where did the data come from?
  * Global variables may complicate this 
*
