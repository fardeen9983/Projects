# Object Oriented Programming

Ruby is an Object oriented language so it implements the popular OOP features:

1. Abstraction
2. Polymorphism
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation

> Note : We are not going into detail about these concepts. YOu can easily look them up somewhere else.

Most important part of OOP in programming is the concept of classes. So far we have written variables and some functions which modify or use teir data.

Now OOP presents us with **Class** which is a custom data structure (We define it) where all the variables and the methods (aka functions) that directly deal with them are placed together and we do it such way that variables of the class are only accessible through the methods (optional actually)

So we can think of class as a blueprint defining what variables and methods it should have. A class itself is nothing by it's own. We instead create an instance of it called an **object**, much like creating a real thing from a blueprint.

So now the class we have created becomes a custom type we can use to create as many objects as we want.

To access the properties (methods and variable) of an object we use the dot (.) operator.
