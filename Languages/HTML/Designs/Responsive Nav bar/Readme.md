This piece of code is aimed at creating a responsive yet straightforward Navigation bar that gives a smooth operation while running on both large to mobile displays.

## Steps

1. Create a starter HTML file
2. In the `body` tag add a `nav` tag with a logo `div` with title and a `ul` list of `li` links using `a`.
3. Create a `stylesheet (style.css)` and link it to the `index.html` file and remove the global padding and margin using the `* selector`.
4. Create a nav style with `display: flex` to bring all the content together, and `justify: space-around` and finally `align-items: center`.
5. Give some coloration and height to the navbar
6. Add google fonts Poppins family.
7. Add logo styling
8. Add styling to navbar links and li, ul tags.
9. The standard navbar view is complete
10. Add a hamburger menu with three lines and disable it for non-mobile views.
11. Change the hamburger styling when the max height is 768px (for mobile view) and add flex to nav-list to look like a hamburger
12. Push the hamburger to 100% off-screen and hide the scrolling behavior
13. Initially hide the li items until the drawer is visible and make the burger visible
14. Animation added to the links and opacity change
