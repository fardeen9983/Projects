# HTML Basics

HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language - defines the structure of a Web Page. It is made up of a collections of elements called *tags* that are organized in such a way as to provide needed information to browser to render the web page properly.

The term HyperText comes from early days of WEB where a website was a collection of static documents which had links to other pages thus allowing navigation without explicit search.

Tags are keywords enclosed in angular brackets. There are variants having just a simple tag or also having a closing tag. Example
```html
<p> This is a paragraph </p>

This is simple HTML text.<br> Now this is break line  to go to next line 
```
