# PyLyrics

Ever fancy mixing Python and music. If you have ever heard of the popular lyrics library which maintains lyrics of well over 2M+ songs, then you will feel free with this package. Honestly I didnt't have much interest in bringing this forward but I was just hatching the idea of getting lyrics with their playtime from a song file, but in the process I stumbled upoon this module. So why not..

> Warning : This module seems to be broken and full of warnings. It is not updated with the latest version BeautifulSoap, hence lots of annoying warnings of missing HTML parser. Also getting lyrics from album tracks throws error. Sadly I am leaving this as it is for now. Will raise issue to the developer if he is maintaining the code or might even create my own later. Dont get into this as of now.

## Features

1. Browse songs from the vast library of songs from [LyricWiki](https://lyrics.fandom.com/wiki/LyricWiki)

2. Get lyrics of songs, searchable through lable, artists, genres and albums.

It's basically a Python wrapper for APIs provided by LyricWiki
