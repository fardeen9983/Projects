# PyLyrics

Ever fancy mixing Python and music. If you have ever heard of the famous lyrics library which maintains lyrics of well over 2M+ songs, then you will feel free with this package. Honestly, I didn't have much interest in bringing this forward, but I was hatching the idea of getting lyrics with their playtime from a song file, but in the process, I stumbled upon this module. So why not...

> Warning: This module seems to be broken and full of warnings. It is not updated with the latest version BeautifulSoap, hence lots of annoying warnings of missing HTML parser. Also, getting lyrics from album tracks throws an error. Sadly I am leaving this as it is for now. I will raise the issue to the developer if he is maintaining the code or might even create my own later. Don't get into this as of now.

## Features

1. Browse songs from the vast library of songs from [LyricWiki](https://lyrics.fandom.com/wiki/LyricWiki)

2. Get lyrics of songs, searchable through labels, artists, genres, and albums.

It's a Python wrapper for APIs provided by LyricWiki.

## Installation

The standard **pip** way. (Make sure to have python and pip adequately set up)

pip install PyLyrics

Or you can use the good old **virtualenv**.
