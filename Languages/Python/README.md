1. ### Web Development

   Using popular frameworks like Django and flask, the power of Python has been brought to the world of dynamic web design. Combining any frontend framework with Django has been made very easy.

   The benefits of a full-stack web framework such as Django for when you require the additional features like security, database connectivity and networking to be built in, or when you need a meagre stack of features to create a working API server using Flask, Python web frameworks are always available for a variety of scale and service requirements

2. ### Machine Learning

   With a global phenomenon rising from the last two decades leading to an abrupt change in the field of Data analysis and how we view the advancement of automation, predictions and analysis through the application of trained algorithms boosted by popular languages and their libraries; Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning have become buzz words.

   With Python being the most popular language with tonnes of features and libraries available to satisfy your thirst to dive deep into ML, it's a no brainer that it will be your first ccoice as a beginner of the field.

   Some applications : Face recognition, object detection, recommendation systems, buisness analytics, etc.

   Popular algorithms : Neural networks, Deep learning, Support Vector machines, Random forest

   Popular libraries: PyTorch, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, Caffe, Keras

3. ### Data analysis and visualisation

   Drawing graphs, visualising data and analysing patterns and forecasting demand and other factors, and drawing conclusions is a hot topic in both tech and non-tech fields.

   Popular libraries : Matplotlib, Seaborn

4. ### Scripting

   This simply refers to writing code that automates a task, from spam filtering to data logging, from automated email forwarding to scrapping data from millions of sites using bots. The applications you can create using Python scripting tools is endless.

5. ### Game Development

   You can use Python for game development; some popular engines coded in python are Pygame. But it is not as effective/popular as industry standard softwares such as Unity or Unreal Engine. Though you can simply use them for hobby projects

6. ### Desktop applications

   It is possible to build cross platform desktop apps using python thanks to libraries such as Tkinter and QT (popular on linux environments), but it is not the most popular option for this.

7. ### Embedded applications

    Python is one of most popular used langage in embedded applications running on IoT frameworks and devices like Raspberry Pi, etc.
